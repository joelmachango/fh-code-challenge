# fh Grants Management Application

Like many other international non-governmental organizations (INGO), Food for the Hungry (FH) receives grants from various sources to aid it in it's core mission of ending hunger worldwide. These grants are normally utilized in various projects as indicated hereÂ https://www.fh.org/grant-projects/
